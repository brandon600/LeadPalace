            <p>Top 6 Books EVERY Real Estate Agent Should Read</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-main-intro-text">
            <p>As a real estate agent, investing in your education is one of the best things that you can do to grow your career and yourself as an agent. It will help you jump over the rest of your competition that isn’t educating themselves and improving, and you don’t want to be part of that group that gets leaped over. There is so much knowledge and education out there that you can use to your advantage as a realtor, and there are so many ways you can go about getting this knowledge. You could watch educational videos, listen to podcasts, read books, attend seminars, etc. I personally like to dabble in all of these, but my favorite way to learn about a subject is definitely by reading books. This has led me to read hundreds of books over the years and I want to share 6 of them with you today that can really help you out as a realtor. I’m giving you 6 because I don’t want to give you too many recommendations to where you don’t know which ones to read and then you end up reading none. I’ve seen that happen plenty of times. So, I put together a list of these 6 books because I believe these 6 can REALLY help your career and have GREAT impact on your growth as an agent. Make it a goal to read these 6 books within the next year. That’s only 1 book every 2 months! You are very well capable of doing that with some discipline and effort. Like I said, these books will REALLY help you, so make setting the time aside to read them will prove to be well worth it. Now, let’s get into these 6 books that I keep talking about!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-main-intro-text">
            <p>Keep in mind that these books are in order of how I would want to read the books if it was my first time reading them as an agent. You can read them in any order you would like to and they will all benefit you along the way as you read them no matter where you start, but this would just be my preference.</p>

                <p>#1 Dirk Zeller – Your First Year In Real Estate</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>I recommend this book for every real estate agent and even people who haven’t become an agent yet but are thinking about becoming one. The author of this book goes over so many things about being a realtor that I haven’t been able to find in any other book. While lots of books for real estate agents focus on giving you the knowledge to become a 6 or 7 figure success, this book helps you out with the getting the fundamentals right. And without getting the fundamental pillars right, your odds of becoming a highly successful agents decrease significantly. I highly recommend this book for every agent because I believe even very experienced agents can pick up some nuggets from this, but I especially recommend this for new agents. Those just starting out or those looking to start soon will benefit most from this book. Check it out!</p>

                <p>#2 Kevin Ward – The Book of Yes</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>This book right here is another one that should be read by all agents. The main reason being is because it’s all about getting better at the SALES part of real estate, which is the one of the only things that never really gets outsourced by the agent. An assistant can handle all of your data entry and lead follow ups, but it’s ultimately up to you as the agent to close the deal. This book will help you get better at doing just that. This book will give you foundational sales knowledge and then some scripts that you can actual use yourself in order to close deals. I highly suggest you check this one out. If you want other book recommendations that really focus on sales, email me at brandon@leadpalace.io and I’d be glad to give you some!</p>

                <p>#3 Gary Keller – The Millionaire Real Estate Agent</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>The Millionaire Real Estate Agent is a GREAT book by Gary Keller that helps you start thinking big. I highly encourage all agents to read this book because it may be different then what you expect. It isn’t about working yourself to death by putting in 70+ hour weeks or anything like that, it’s about breaking down exactly what you need to do in order to efficiently scale a real estate sales business to 7 figures. That’s exactly what the author did. The work it outlines for you to do will definitely require large effort on your part, but if you follow this book, you’ll either make a million selling real estate, or you’ll know the numbers you need to be hitting and the adjustments you need to make in order to hit that million-dollar mark. This book is less practical when it comes to the advice that agents can use on the day-to-day, but it really helps the agent build the picture in their mind of their million dollar real estate business and what it will take to get there. Check this one out!</p>

                <p>#4 Gary Keller – The One Thing</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>The next recommendation I have for you is another one by Gary Keller which is called “The One Thing.” I recommend this book to not only all real estate agents, but all entrepreneurs, and honestly just everyone in general that is attempting to live a productive life. The problem in life, especially now in the modern world, is that there is SO much going on and SO many things to do. Because of this, we can sometimes be easily distracted and spend time doing things that we actually even think are productive, but are really not. This can especially be a problem for real estate agents and this book will help you solve that. As a real estate agent, there are TONS of different things you can do with your time that you may consider productive. This can cause agents, just like other entrepreneurs, to feel like they are doing so much work and being so productive, but aren’t getting the level of results they think they should be getting for their efforts. The key to fixing this problem is finding the small amount of things, or the ONE thing that gives you the best results of your time. Gary Keller says to find the one thing that you can do that which when you do it, it takes care of a large part of your other problems as well. He refers to it as the domino effect and says to ask yourself “What’s the one thing I can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” The points on that alone made the book worth it to me and I really recommend you check it out to gain all of the knowledge that’s inside that book. It could help you save TONS of time.</p>

                <p>#5 Dale Carnegie - How To Win Friends & Influence People</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>Being a good social person is of course part of being a real estate agent. You have to be able to not only be good at establishing a relationship with someone, but be able to maintain and nurture that relationship through the whole buying/selling process, and then even after that in order to generate repeat business or referrals from that person. “How To Win Friends & Influence People” is a classic by Dale Carnegie that can really help you gain a lot more social awareness and make you much better at communicating with people. There’s lots of practical help in here that you can utilize to become better socially, but the main reason I’m recommending it is because of the overall theme and concept of how to be successful when operating socially. It really is perspective changing and I think it can really help the way you see people and the world. But, the book I really like for lots of different practical info on how to become better socially, is the next book on the list. I highly recommend you read this book first, then check out book #6 “The Like Switch”, which we’ll get into next.</p>

                <p>#6 Jack Shafer – The Like Switch</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>This is another book that I recommend to pretty much everyone who wants to operate well in a social environment and develop good relationships with people. “The Like Switch” goes over tons of practical tips that you can start implementing right away to become a lot better socially. As you can see by the cover, the author is an ex-FBI agent who became specialized in behavior analysis. He definitely knows a thing or two about advanced social cues, signs, and tips that you may have never thought of before. And it’s all very easy to understand. As a real estate agent, you’re constantly dealing with new faces so it’s good to know how to be able to read them and be able to give them the side of yourself that works best with them. Not only for courtesy, but because you never know when someone might throw a referral right into your lap just because of how easy you were to talk to! This book is definitely well worth the read and I highly recommend checking it out!</p>
