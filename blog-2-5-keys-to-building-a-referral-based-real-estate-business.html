            <p>5 Keys To Building A Successful, Referral-Based Business For Real Estate Agents</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-main-intro-text">
            <p>As a real estate agent, investing in your education is one of the best things that you can do to grow your career and yourself as an agent. It will help you jump over the rest of your competition that isn’t educating themselves and improving, and you don’t want to be part of that group that gets leaped over. There is so much knowledge and education out there that you can use to your advantage as a realtor, and there are so many ways you can go about getting this knowledge. You could watch educational videos, listen to podcasts, read books, attend seminars, etc. I personally like to dabble in all of these, but my favorite way to learn about a subject is definitely by reading books. This has led me to read hundreds of books over the years and I want to share 6 of them with you today that can really help you out as a realtor. I’m giving you 6 because I don’t want to give you too many recommendations to where you don’t know which ones to read and then you end up reading none. I’ve seen that happen plenty of times. So, I put together a list of these 6 books because I believe these 6 can REALLY help your career and have GREAT impact on your growth as an agent. Make it a goal to read these 6 books within the next year. That’s only 1 book every 2 months! You are very well capable of doing that with some discipline and effort. Like I said, these books will REALLY help you, so make setting the time aside to read them will prove to be well worth it. Now, let’s get into these 6 books that I keep talking about!</p>

        <div class="blog-main-intro-text">
            <p>We understand it’s much harder for a new agent to build a referral base, but the sooner one gets started, the better. This is of course because having 100% of your business come by referral is a goal you want to achieve at some point in the future. It’s always better to get started now, and we’re going to share with you the key areas to focus on to build a strong and large referral base whether your in your first year, or 2 decades in. These are the 6 keys to building a referral based real estate business.</p>

        <div class="blog-main-point">
            <div class="blog-point-title">
                <p>#1 Deliver Outstanding Service</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>The first and most important key to building a referral based real estate business is to deliver outstanding service. This key here may seem obvious to you, but according to the real estate agents we spoke with, this isn’t something that they’d say a lot of agents follow, or at least place high importance on. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>My first question was why would this not be the main thing an agent focuses on, when people will only send them referrals if they were very well taken care of themselves, or knew someone who was very well taken care of by them as an agent? The reply was that what is seen in lots of agents in the real estate game, is that they focus more on getting more clients, rather than taking extreme care of the one’s they already have. They also made the point that most agents they see don’t completely neglect their clients or deliver terrible service, but that rather they just put chasing new leads as their main priority because they might believe that more clients means more business in the short-term, and more business in the long-term when those clients deliver referrals to them in the future. But, the mistake these agents make is assume that all of their previous clients will automatically pass referrals along to them, when in reality, those referrals only come when high quality service is delivered. None of the agents we spoke to said lead generation wasn’t important. That wasn’t the case at all. They just let us know that delivering exceptional service to the clients you have is a very essential factor in building a nice strong referral base. Delivering exceptional service will have people voluntarily bringing you up in their conversations, while not impressing your clients will leave them forgetting your name, or worse, saying something negative about you/their experience with you. Deliver OUTSTANDING service.</p>

                <p>#2 Offer Tailored Treatment</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>This key builds on the last one of delivering outstanding service, but it’s a lot more practical than just saying the cliché “deliver the best experience.” We didn’t just want to give you that, so here is a STRONG and practical tip on how you can deliver that outstanding experience. This is something that not only applies to real estate sales, but sales in general.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>Offering treatment to your clients that fits their specific needs, wants, likes, values, etc. is essential when trying to deliver the best service to them as possible. This can sound like a lot of work, but it’s actually not in most cases. This is because you will find that by just adjusting your manner, tone, words, communication style, and things like that will add more to your clients experience then anything else. Delivering the best experience possible for your clients doesn’t mean buying them dinner, sending them a gift basket, or driving them around for hours. It can sometimes mean those things, but the main point to understand is that each of your clients will want and expect different treatment, and it’s your job as the agent to give your best guess at what they want based on their personality and what they tell you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>Some of your clients will tell everyone they talk to about selling/buying their home that you’re the best agent in town simply because you sent them a gift basket with a handwritten letter. Maybe you showed up late a couple times for appointments, no big deal, they’re past that and are just happy you finished the job and thought about them enough to send them a nice gift. On the other hand, you may deliver the same exact experience to another one of your clients and they might never mention you or tell other people they know that need an agent to make sure they find one that shows up on time because theirs did not. This type of client obviously places a lot more value on punctuality than the first one.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>The point here is that you have to adjust the experience depending on the client. The reason I say this can be easier than just trying to deliver the same “best” experience to everyone is that some clients will be easier to take care of than others. Some just want to have a dinner with you where you listen to their stories or whatever they have to say. After that, they trust you and like you and will gladly send business your way when you close the deal. Others don’t want any of that and just want the deal to close and if they place all of their interest and value in that, they’ll gladly send you business once it closes without ever thinking twice about the fact they didn’t have dinner with you. You don’t have to take every client out to eat, you don’t have to drive every one of your clients around for hours, you don’t have to call each of your clients every single day, but what you do have to do if you want to deliver exceptional service is to find out what they value and care about most in a real estate agent, then be that to the best of your abilities. Offer tailored treatment.</p>

                <p>#3 Ask, At The Appropriate Time</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>Another key that we got from the real estate agents that we spoke to was to simply ask; and ask at the right time. One of the agents we spoke to said he would ask a few times for a referral through ought the whole process not only to seize potential current opportunities, but also to make sure he said it enough times that it would stick with his clients long after the deal was closed. He’s a pretty upbeat and humorous guy so he said he would ask for referrals in both a serious tone and a playful joking type tone whenever the moment permitted it. He recommended to not ask for a referral right after closing the sale, as that’s the last thing on your client’s mind when going through a move. He recommended to ask at least once while working with the client, and another time later when you follow up with the client a week or so after moving (a call that he also recommends every agent make.)</p>

            <div class="blog-point-title">
                <p>#4 Qualify & Categorize Your Network</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>A point that one of the agents made that I thought was huge was to categorize all of the people in your network that you’d like to generate referrals from. Not only do you want to categorize people by the industry they work in and/or how they relate to you, but you also want to categorize them by how much you need to be reaching out to them. Some of the people in your network need more than a Christmas card from you, or don’t need/want to receive a call from you every month. The customized experience for your client doesn’t stop after the deal is closed! Split up your network into separate categories and you can have a different follow-up process for each of them that will give you the best chance at receiving a referral from them. Previous clients don’t want to be contacted like your B2B connections, and your B2B connections likely don’t want to be contacted like your friends. The challenge with previous clients is making sure they keep you in mind, the challenge with your business connections is making sure they know you can still do the job with quality, and the challenge with the people that like you personally keep liking you. Because of this, following up with each kind of person will be different.</p>

        <div class="blog-main-point">
            <div class="blog-point-title">
                <p>#5 WORK</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>The last key I want to share here is something all of the agents we talked to mentioned, which is that a referral based real estate business doesn’t mean the agent can just relax and not do any work, but that they must actually keep up the same work ethic that got them those referrals in the first place.  If the service drops, so will the number of referrals coming in, which is definitely something you want to keep in mind as a real estate agent. They wanted us to understand that lots of agents believe that once they gain experience, build a track record, and have more and more referrals coming in, that they will be able to kick their feet up and laugh their way to the bank all day. They let us know that this is possible, but it’s not the case just because an agent has a referral-based business. As long as you’re selling real estate, or really anything for that matter, key #1 still applies; especially if you want the referrals to keep coming in. Until you have a team to do the work and deliver the quality service for you, you will still have to do it and be a part of it yourself. As long as you’re willing to do that work and follow the 4 other keys we shared here as well, there’s no doubt in the minds of myself or any of the agents we spoke to that you will be able to build a successful referral-based real estate business.</p>
